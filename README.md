<b>Technologies & Tools Utilized:</b> JavaScript, OMDb API, Swiper.js, HTML & CSS.</b> This project was inspired directly from popular streaming platforms such as Netflix. This project highlights the use of working with third party API's to dynamically change the user interface with JavaScript.

- I was able to implement new HTML5 features such as videos to give the user interface a more dynamimc view and went with the more semantic approach of using HTML elements to give more users a better experience and accessibility.
- With just regular CSS I was able to create responsive layouts that looks well on every device.
- On the JavaScript side I took advantage of asynchronous programming and promises to retrieve data from the OMDb API.

## Features
- Mobile, Desktop, iPad, Tablets & other device type friendly.
